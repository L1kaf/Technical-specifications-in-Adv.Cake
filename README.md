This repository is a technical assignment in Adv.Cake. The assignment itself looks like this:
```
Write a method that takes a string as input and reverses the order of letters in each word while preserving case and punctuation.

For example:
$result = revertCharacters("Hi, long time no see.");
echo $result; // Ih! Gnol emit on ees.

Also write unit tests for this method.
```

The 'src' folder contains the class with the required method. And in the 'tests' folder there is a unit-test for this method.
